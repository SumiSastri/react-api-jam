**History**

REST was coined by Roy Fielding as a part of his PhD dissertation.

The early history of the web began in the early 1980s in Switzerland at the CERN physics lab. Sir Tim Berners‑Lee wrote a system called Enquire to help him keep track of different people, projects, and computers that were being used.

That first program didn't have any network connectivity, but it managed data as multiple documents that were connected via hyperlinks.

And even then, he had a vision of this globally linked information space.

As 1990 approached, Sir Tim Berners‑Lee had learned of this thing called the internet and was given approval to build his hypertext‑based system as a part of testing out programming of what has become the World Wide Web. It was both a browser and an editor, and it ran over the internet.

There were three novel innovations that formed the web. They were, in order of importance, URL, HTTP, and HTML.

URL, or as it was then called UDI, or universal document identifier, was considered the most important because it was the only thing that Sir Tim Berners‑Lee thought required conformance by all of the web's participants.

HTTP is a feature‑rich protocol.

HTML is to ignore why the web spread so fast. It was a simple format that programs could be built against with relative ease.

More recognizable web browsers started including Netscape and the start of the browser wars.

Roy Fielding got involved in efforts to develop formal standards around those early innovations. Remember URL, HTTP, and HTML. Because of how fast the web had grown, much of the early specification work was really just trying to catch up and document the implementations that had already been created.

On top of that, the standards committee was also working on the proposal for the next version of HTTP. That's HTTP 1.1. Now this was a really tough problem because as the growth of the web continued at this exponential rate, new and a lot of times commercial interests had very different ideas about how it should work. And without any clear design rationale, it was difficult to know how to evaluate all of the proposed extensions that were coming in for the protocol.

So to help him capture the rationale for the web's existing design and then use that as a framework for evaluating all of these proposals, as he put it, to avoid breaking the web, Fielding conceived of REST. The ideas evolved along with the web, and eventually, of course, they made their way into Fielding's PhD dissertation, which was picked up several years later and became the subject of countless debates and blog posts.

REST is not some prescription for how to build APIs that was conceived in isolation. It's a description of an entire system's architecture, one in particular, the World Wide Web.
